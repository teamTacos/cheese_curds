I'd like to do something with this.

I'm just not sure what that thing is.

But there's cheese.

####Cho-Han

Chō-Han Bakuchi or simply Chō-Han (丁半?)) is a traditional Japanese gambling game using dice.

The game uses two standard six-sided dice, which are shaken in a bamboo cup or bowl by a dealer. The cup is then overturned onto the floor. Players then place their wagers on whether the sum total of numbers showing on the two dice will be "Chō" (even) or "Han" (odd). The dealer then removes the cup, displaying the dice. The winners collect their money.
